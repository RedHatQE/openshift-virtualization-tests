## Running the tests

### NOTE - Running chaos tests

`chaos` tests disrupt the cluster in different ways in order to build confidence in the robustness of `OpenShift Virtualization`.

To run the chaos tests:

```bash
uv run pytest <pytest_args> -m chaos
```

### Basic run of all tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

To see optional CLI arguments run:

```bash
uv run pytest --help
```

### Using CLI arguments

CLI arguments can be passed to pytest by setting them in [pytest.ini](../pytest.ini).
You can either use the default pytest.ini file and pass CLI arguments or create a custom one.
For example, add the below under the `addopts` section:
```code
    --skip-artifactory-check
```

Then pass the path to the custom pytest.ini file to pytest:

```bash
uv run pytest -c custom-pytest.ini

```

### Running specific tests
To run a particular set of tests, you can use name pattern matching.
For example, to run all tests that contain `test_clone_windows_vm` or `test_migrate_vm` in their names:

```bash
uv run pytest <pytest_args> -k "test_clone_windows_vm or test_migrate_vm"
```

To run all network component tests:

```bash
uv run pytest <pytest_args> -m network
```

#### Selecting network IP version type tests

You can use marker matching to select tests based on their IP version type.
The available markers are: ipv4 and ipv6.
These markers are useful when running tests in an IPv4 or IPv6 single-stack cluster.

For example, to run only the IPV4 network tests:

```bash
uv run pytest -m "network and ipv4"
```

You can also run all IPV4 network tests in addition to all the other general
tests that are not specifically marked with IP version type marker:

```bash
uv run pytest -m "network and not ipv6"
```

### Skip cluster sanity checks
By default, cluster sanity checks are run to make cluster ready for tests.
To skip cluster sanity checks, pass `--cluster-sanity-skip-check` to skip all tests.
To skip specific node checks, pass `--cluster-sanity-skip-nodes-check`.
To skip specific storage checks, pass `--cluster-sanity-skip-storage-check`.
To skip virt specific checks, pass `--skip-virt-sanity-check`.
To skip tests which require access to internal images, pass `--skip-artifactory-check`.


### Custom global_config to override the matrix value

To override the matrix value, you can create your own `global_config` file and pass the necessary parameters.

Example for AWS cluster:

`--tc-file=tests/global_config_aws.py --storage-class-matrix=px-csi-db-shared`

Example for SNO cluster:

`--tc-file=tests/global_config_sno.py --storage-class-matrix=lvms-vg1`

#### Running tests with an admin client instead of an unprivileged client
To run tests with an admin client only, pass `--tc=no_unprivileged_client:True` to pytest.


### Running tests using matrix fixtures

Matrix fixtures can be added in global_config.py.
You can run a test using a subset of a simple matrix (i.e flat list), example:

```bash
--tc=ip_stack_version_matrix:ipv4
```

To run a test using a subset of a complex matrix (e.g list of dicts), you'll also need to add
the following to `openshift-virtualization-tests/conftest.py`

- Add `parser.addoption` under `pytest_addoption` (the name must end with `_matrix`)

Multiple keys can be selected by passing them with `,`

Available storage classes can be found in `global_config.py` under `storage_class_matrix` dictionary.

Example:

```bash
--storage-class-matrix=ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization,hostpath-csi-basic
```
### Using matrix fixtures

Using matrix fixtures requires providing a scope.
Format:

```
<type>_matrix__<scope>__
```

Example:

```
storage_class_matrix__module__
storage_class_matrix__class__
```

### Using customized matrix fixtures

You can customize existing matrix with function logic.
For example, when tests need to run on storage matrix but only on storage
with snapshot capabilities.

Add a desired function logic to `pytest_matrix_utils.py`

```
def foo_matrix(matrix):
    <customize matrix code>
    return matrix
```

Example:

```
storage_class_matrix_foo_matrix__module__
storage_class_matrix_foo_matrix__class__
```


### jira integration
Pytest_jira plugin allows you to link tests to existing tickets.
To use the plugin during a test run, use '--jira.'
Issues are considered as resolved if their status appears in resolved_statuses (verified, release pending, closed),
that are set as an environment variable in openshift-virtualization-tests GitHub repository, and saved to the temporary file jira.cfg.
You can mark a test to be skipped if a Jira issue is not resolved.
Example:

```
@pytest.mark.jira("CNV-1234", run=False)
```

You can mark a test to be marked as xfail if a Jira issue is not resolved.
Example:

```
@pytest.mark.jira("CNV-1234")
```

To use jira plugin, you need to set the following environment variables:
```bash
export PYTEST_JIRA_URL=<url>
export PYTEST_JIRA_TOKEN=<your_token>
```

## Additional options
There are other parameters that can be passed to the test suite if needed.

```bash
--tc-file=tests/global_config.py
--tc-format=python
--junitxml /tmp/xunit_results.xml
--jira
```

### Logging

Log file 'pytest-tests.log' is generated with the full pytest output in openshift-virtualization-tests root directory.
For each test failure cluster log is collected and stored under 'tests-collected-info'.


#### Setting log level in command line

To run a test with a log level that is different from the default,
use the --log-cli-level command line switch.
The full list of possible log level strings can be found here:
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels>

When the switch is not used, we set the default level to INFO.

Example:

```bash
--log-cli-level=DEBUG
```

To see verbose logging of a test run, add the following parameter:

```bash
uv run pytest <test_to_run> -o log_cli=true
```

### Must-gather and data collection
When you pass the `--data-collector` flag, **openshift-virtualization-tests** will gather must-gather archives, pexpect logs, and alert data for failure analysis. By default, collected logs land in:

- `tests-collected-info/` for local runs
- `/data/tests-collected-info/` for containerized runs (i.e., when youâ€™ve exported the `CNV_TESTS_CONTAINER` environment variable)

```bash
uv run pytest <test_to_run> --data-collector
```

If you need to override the default output directory, use --data-collector-output-dir:

```bash
uv run pytest <test_to_run> \
  --data-collector \
  --data-collector-output-dir=<path/to/your/dir>
```

To skip must-gather collection on a given module or test, skip_must_gather_collection can be used:

```bash
pytest.mark.skip_must_gather_collection
```

## Network utility container

Check containers/utility/README.md

#### Run command on nodes

`ExecCommandOnPod` is used to run command on nodes

##### Example

`workers_utility_pods` and `control_plane_utility_pods` are fixtures that hold the pods.

```python
pod_exec = ExecCommandOnPod(utility_pods=workers_utility_pods, node=node)
out = pod_exec.exec(command=cmd, ignore_rc=True)
```

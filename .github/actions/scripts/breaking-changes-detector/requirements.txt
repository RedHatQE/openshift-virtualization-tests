# Breaking Changes Detector Requirements
# 
# This tool is designed to use only Python standard library modules
# for maximum compatibility and minimal dependencies.
# 
# The following are optional dependencies that can enhance functionality
# but are not required for basic operation:

# For enhanced testing (if running tests)
# pytest>=7.0.0

# For YAML configuration support (future enhancement)
# PyYAML>=6.0

# For enhanced git operations (alternative to subprocess calls)
# GitPython>=3.1.0

# No required dependencies - uses Python standard library only
